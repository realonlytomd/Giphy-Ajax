# Giphy-Ajax
This is a deceptively simple app that performs ajax calls to the popular gif site Giphy.com. Click on one of the TV show buttons and 10 gifs dynamically appear below. A click on each turns the animation on; another click turns it off. The results are randomized so that the user gets different gifs with repeated calls.
